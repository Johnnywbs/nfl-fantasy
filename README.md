# nfl-fantasy
A NFL Fantasy website made with Springboot, React and Postgres DB
\n
Tips for using the site: \n
  Install Java and Node.js in yput computer\n
  This still a work in progress so some elements can change\n
  To use the Database you need to import the CSV file to a table.\n
  Both Frontend and Backend need to be running at the same time to work\n
  In the future I will launch a docker version so it can be easier to deploy the aplication :)\n
